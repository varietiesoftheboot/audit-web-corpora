### Repository structure

The repository includes folders denoting audited language portions (ISO 639-3 codes) of web-crawled multilingual corpora. Each folder contains tab-separated files (`.tsv`) for audited material for the language portion (the column `classification` indicates the annotation for each row, and `notes` the additional observations):

- `lmo`: manual audit for the `lmo` portion on OSCAR v22.01;
- `pms`: manual audit for the `pms` portion on OSCAR v22.01;
- `scn`: manual audit for the `scn` portion on OSCAR v22.01 and WikiMatrix (i.e., parallel subset `it-scn`);
- `srd`: manual audit for the `srd` portion on CCAligned (i.e., parallel subset `en-sc`).

*Note that the `en-lmo` parallel subset of WikiMatrix has already been audited in [Kreutzer et al. (2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.tacl-1.4/).*

The corpora have been originally introduced in [Abadji et al. (2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.463/) (OSCAR v22.01), [Schwenk et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.115/) (WikiMatrix), and [El-Kishky et al. (2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.480/) (CCAligned).
